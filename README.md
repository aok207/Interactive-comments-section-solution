## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Create, Read, Update, and Delete comments and replies
- Upvote and downvote comments
- **Bonus**: If you're building a purely front-end project, use `localStorage` to save the current state in the browser that persists when the browser is refreshed.
- **Bonus**: Instead of using the `createdAt` strings from the `data.json` file, try using timestamps and dynamically track the time since the comment or reply was posted.

## My process
I ended up making it front-end only. So I used the localstorage to store the comments.

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- Tailwind CSS
- TypeScript

### What I learned

I learned a lot about typescript. And for React, I particularly learnt a lot about passing data from child to parent component.

### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://bobbyhadz.com/blog/react-pass-data-from-child-to-parent) - This helped me understand how to pass data between child and parent component.
